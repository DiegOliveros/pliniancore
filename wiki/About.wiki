   Plinian Core aims to be a standard for sharing information
mainly at the species level. It was conceived as a way to publish
species information and to make it interoperable. By “species
information” we refer to all kinds of properties and traits
related to taxa (of any rank), including descriptions,
nomenclature, conservation status, management, natural
history, etc. Thus, Plinian Core coverage goes beyond
taxonomic descriptions.
The objective of this poster is to present the process and
advances of the conceptual development of Plinian Core v3.1
(abstract model) and its implementation (application profiles).
